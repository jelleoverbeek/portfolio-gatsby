        The event page of TicketSwap is the most viewed on the platform. On this
        page listings thousands of fans are trying to get a ticket to their
        favourite event. Jim and I worked together on the UX and I finished the
        UI and led the implementation of the design. By researching Hotjar,
        doing a survey, digging through the testimonials and the contact moments
        with our support team we composed those goals.

      <Goals>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Revamp UI of the page.</li>

          Users land on this page from either our search our Google, the page
          gives a clear overview of the info the event, the supply and demand,
          the available ticket types and artists performing at the event.

        <p>
          Here users spend a lot of time trying to get a ticket. To create trust
          and make the page feel personal we show avatars of the sellers. The
          comments that sellers can add to their listing sometimes create funny
          situations that get shared on social media.

        <p>
          We changed the ticket alert behaviour from a traditional button that
          triggered a form to a simple toggle. The user can also set a price
          limit to only receive alerts for tickets offered below a certain
          price. Changing the behaviour increased the amount of conversions.

        <p>
          Since about a year we are also selling organizer tickets on our
          platform. To make it the listing more trustworthy a verified badge was
          added. When doing our research we discovered that sellers went to the
          event page directly after creating their listing but couldnâ€™t see it
          yet, this resulted in a lot of users contacting support. Listings only
          show up after a few minutes to give people with ticket alerts enabled
          a higher change and to combat bots. To solve this issue without giving
          bots a chance and hurting the app downloads conversion we will now
          show the newly created to the seller only.

          Every artist card contains a follow button, this makes it very easy
          for users to follow all the artists they like without having to search
          them all individually. Read more about{" "}

        <p>
          At the bottom of each event page the user can find similar events.
          This is useful when there are for example no tickets available for the
          event the user wants to visit, in that situation the user can find a
          worthy alternative. The badges with the favourite artists of the user
          are an extra trigger to visit those event pages.
