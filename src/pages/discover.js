        The event page of TicketSwap is the most viewed on the platform. On this
        page listings thousands of fans are trying to get a ticket to their
        favourite show. Jim and I worked together on the UX and I finished the
        UI and led the implementation of the design. By researching Hotjar,
        conducting a survey, digging through the testimonials and the contact
        moments with our support team we composed those goals:
      </p>

      <Goals>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Refresh UI of the page</li>
          <li>Simplify ticket alert behaviour</li>
          <li>
            Decrease questions of users where there newly created listings are.
          </li>
          <li>Make users aware that refreshing doesnâ€™t help.</li>
        </ul>
