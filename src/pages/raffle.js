        TicketSwap is a marketplace for second hand e-tickets. Most people come
        to TicketSwap if the official ticket sale has been sold out. Because it
        is sold out, there is often a huge demand for tickets while the supply
        is low. People enable ticket alerts if there are no available tickets
        when they visit the platform. A ticket alert is a push notification that
        will be send as soon as a new ticket becomes available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tickets are sometimes in such high demand that thousands of people
        are waiting for a notification and immediately tap on it. Currently the
        first person to press the buy button will reserve the ticket in their
        cart, leaving the other people disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
        People lose trust in our system after trying many times. They think bots
        are getting all the tickets or that our app is broken. Another
        frustration is that they have to spend a lot of time on their phones
        being ready to tap the push notification and the buy button.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience is the most frustrating part of TicketSwap. A lot of
        users complain about it on social media, in reviews, and to our support
        team.

        <p>
          We started our research by investigating how our current system
          exactly works. Weâ€™ve also looked at what was tried previously. We
          learned that the system is sending the notifications out in batches.
          The batches are added to a queue. It can take as much as 2 minutes
          before the last notification is sent out. The tickets are often
          already reserved within those minutes. Because of this a lot of people
          open the notification for nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past we've also tried to not notify people if a ticket was
          already reserved. This resulted in users thinking their app wasn't
          working properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also confirmed our assumption that older devices have a lower
          chance of getting a ticket. The listing page will take longer to load
          and so the button can only be pressed later. The same applies to
          people with a slower internet connection. We thought this was not fair
          and also wanted to solve this issue.
        </p>

        <p>
          This part of the research added the following requirements to our
          solution:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            It can take up to 2 minutes to send out all ticket alerts. This is
            the minimum time we should wait before making the ticket available
            to buy.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have to sent a notification to every user that enabled ticket
            alerts. Even if the ticket is not available anymore. When we don't
            do that people will think their app is not working properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The solution must be independent on the quality of the device or
            network being used. This is required to make the solution fair.
          </li>
        </ul>

        title="What users are doing right now to get tickets"

      >
        <p>
          After researching our technology we started investigating what our
          users are doing right now. By interviewing our users and looking up
          data we found out three patterns:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            They tap on the place where the notification appears and on the
            place of the buy button while waiting for a new ticket alert to pop
            up.
          </li>
          <li>They refresh the event page and wait for a listing to appear.</li>
          <li>They try to use bots, which is unfair to other users.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Except for the users that are trying to use bots, and risking a ban
          while doing that, we confirmed that a lot of frustration is caused by
          endless refreshing or tapping in the pursuit of a ticket.
        </p>

        <p>We added two new requirements to our solution:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The solution should decrease the effort and time the users have to
            put into getting a ticket.
          </li>
          <li>
            A nice to have is that the new solution decreaeses the problems of
            bots. We threaded this as a nice to have because there are also
            other ways to do this than by changing the system.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <Chapter title="Possible directions" type="border">
        <p>
          Except for researching our own technology and user behavior we also
          did an extensive benchmark. We looked at what our competitors are
          doing but also at how other situations with high demand and low supply
          are handled. After this we went into brainstorming directions. We
          filtered out three viable directions.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>
              A first come, first serve approach in the form of a waitlist:{" "}
            </b>
            The first person that subscribes to the list, will get the first
            ticket that becomes available.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>A lottery approach:</b> Tickets that become available will be
            randomly distributed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>An auction:</b> The highest bidder gets the ticket.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The first come, first serve approach could decrease the growth of our
          platform. This because the length of a waitlist will make it
          impossible for new users to get a ticket. A lottery approach is
          interesting but can also be very demotivating because of the lack of
          control and low chance of getting a ticket. The auction was quickly
          dismissed because at TicketSwap the selling price is capped at 120% of
          the original price. We do this to reduce scalping and keep prices
          fair. In an auction there would simply be way too much bids of the
          same maximum price. Based on these arguments we decided to first take
          a look at the lottery direction.

        <p>
          After a lot of brainstorming, sketching and ideation we came up with a
          concept called: The Raffle.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the new concept we will hold a raffle for every listing. The
          raffle will be drawn within 2 minutes after the creation of a new
          listing. This ensures that the seller also has a quick selling
          experience. During the draw we will show everything that is going on
          to keep the process transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every ticket inside the listing a winner will be picked at random.
          Losers will have more chance to win the next raffle. Increasing the
          chance of the losers, and making this visible, is a reward for putting
          in effort to get a ticket.
        </p>

      <Chapter title="Design, Prototype, Test, Repeat" type="border">
        <p>
          Now the next challenge is to explain the concept of a raffle in a
          short and clear way to our users. After sketching out different ways
          to do this we jumped into a few intense days of designing, prototyping
          and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this phase we focused mainly on creating the flow that
          explained how the raffle works in a non-frustrating way. We also
          wanted to make sure that people perceived the raffle as a fair way of
          distributing tickets.
        </p>
        <p>
          We tried to explain the raffle in a lot of different ways. The
          conclusion of our user tests was that people understood the concept
          the best by experiencing it. During the experience we are giving short
          explanations.

      >
        <p>
          The biggest win in clarity was made by changing the visual
          representation of the chance to win. We first used a thunder icon and
          called it a "chance boost". Later we changed this to a four leaved
          clover. The clover is a symbol of luck used in many countries across
          the world. The four leaved clover immediately made it clear that it
          was about increasing luck. The thunder icon gave the impression that
          the user with the highest score always wins.

          Our plan to release the feature during the festival season of 2020
          fell in the water because of corona. Luckily there were a few events
          with tickets in high demand where we could test the feature. Below are
          two videos of how it looks when you win, and of how it looks when you
          lose.
        </p>
        <p>
          These tests went very well and we got quite some enthusiastic
          responses. During these tests we collected valuable feedback that we
          are going to use for the launch version of the raffle. Hopefully we
          will launch it in 2021 when events get started again. Once it's
          released I will definitely add any metrics and reactions from users
          here.
