      <p>
        When working with Abstract we made use of the design review feature.
        While this feature was pretty useful in general I was struggling with
        one thing: having a clear overview of all the given feedback and being
        able to check them off. When Abstract released their SDK I used this to
        create an app to solve this problem and learn how to use Electron and
        React.
